# Notes

class = "good red hi" has 3 classes good, red and hi

npm - package manager
npx - excute only package
node - run Javascript outside browser -> on machine and **servers**

React - Single Page Application

npx create-react-app projectName

Open in VSCode

npm start - start server (opens browser)

Local:            http://localhost:3000        
On Your Network:  http://192.168.56.1:3000  --> On same Wifi

In public  folder
- favicon.ico - icon on chrome
-index.html - Single page index.html -change title, add bootstrap etc., limited use

src folder - all development done here
- App.js - main file

React - components mein tuti hui

JSX - Javascript Syntax Extension - insert dynamic javascript to react component - mixture of html and javascript

{logo} javascript variable has {}
eg. { javascript code} as App.js mein html bhi hai so javascript {} ke andar hi hoga

import './App.css'; - is line se CSS add hoti hai page mein

2 types of component - class and function based

Abhi function based karo

IMP - inside return start and end with empty <> </> to wrap entire code in one thing
i.e.

<>
.......................Code.................
</>

For tabs like hr which have no end / type it as <hr /> instead of <hr>

REPLACE class with className (as class not in JSX due to conflicts>

Can copy paste from https://react-bootstrap.github.io/ if you want

{ props.searchBar ?


      <form className="d-flex" role="search">
        <input className="form-control me-2" type="search" placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search"/>
        <button className="btn btn-outline-success" type="submit">Search</button>
      </form>
      : "No search bar"
      
      }


















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
